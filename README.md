BOI_box
=======

Arduino Leonardo based arcade style joystick with four buttons and button-combo support
The joystick registers as a keyboard when plugged in to a PC and the button bindings are reprogrammable via serial port.

I am especially proud of the arrays of pointers to the structs.

There's currently 3 versions of the code:

V6: The one with all the combos enabled.

V6_NO_COMBOS: Take a wild guess at how this is different...

V6_SUPERMEATBOY: Tweaked some timing issues and removed some combos to match the gameplay of "Super Meat Boy"
